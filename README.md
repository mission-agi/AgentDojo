## What Is This?

AgentDojo is a skill system for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Each skill is a standalone agent — type a slash command and it reads your codebase, analyzes the problem, and produces real output (code, docs, designs, test plans).

**Not a framework. Not a library. Just skills you install and use.**

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/mission-agi/AgentDojo.git

# Copy slash commands to Claude
cp -r AgentDojo/claude/commands/ ~/.claude/commands/

# Copy orchestrator
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/orchestrator
cp AgentDojo/orchestrator/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md

# Copy domain agents
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/agents
cp AgentDojo/agents/*.md ~/.claude/skills/agents/

# Done. Open Claude Code and type any skill command.
```

### Verify It Works

```bash
claude
# Then type:
/sde-tdd my-feature
```

If the skill loads, you're good.

### Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI
- A project repository to work in

## How It Works

### Skills Read Your Code

Every skill reads your actual codebase. `/sde-code-review` reads your PR diffs. `/qae-security` scans your source files. `/ux-accessibility` audits your HTML. No dummy output — real analysis of real code.

### Skills Write Real Output

Skills produce files in domain-specific directories:

```
pm/    — PRDs, gap analyses, competitor profiles, experiment briefs
pe/    — Strategy docs, ADRs, quality assessments, migration plans
sde/   — Architecture reviews, TDD sessions, system designs
qae/   — Test strategies, CI/CD configs, security reports
ux/    — Design tokens, component specs, accessibility audits
```

### Skills Chain Together

Output from one skill feeds the next:

```
Research Agent → Gap Analyst → PRD Generator → GitHub Issues
                                    ↓
                        UX Design System → Component Design
                                    ↓
                           SDE TDD → Code Review
                                    ↓
                        QAE Test Strategy → CI/CD Pipeline
```

### Master Orchestrator

The `/orchestrator` command runs the full product lifecycle in 9 phases:

```
Phase 1: Discovery        — PM research, gap analysis
Phase 2: Strategy          — PE tech strategy, UX design system
Phase 3: Architecture      — PE architecture review
Phase 4: Requirements      — PM PRD, SDE requirements
Phase 5: Design            — UX components, SDE system design
Phase 6: Implementation    — SDE TDD, code craftsman (with quality gates)
Phase 7: Quality           — QAE test strategy, security, performance
Phase 8: Integration       — Cross-domain validation
Phase 9: Launch            — Metrics, monitoring, retrospective
```

4 user decision gates at strategic boundaries. Automatic skill loop exit criteria. Cross-domain feedback loops (SDE finds bugs → QAE validates → SDE fixes).
